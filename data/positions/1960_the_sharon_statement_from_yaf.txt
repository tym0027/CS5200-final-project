1960 the sharon statement from yaf,speech,1960-09-11,https://www.yaf.org/news/the-sharon-statement/,young americans for freedom
In this time of moral and political crises, it is the responsibility of the youth of America to affirm certain eternal truths.
the self
We, as young conservatives, believe: That foremost among the transcendent values is the individual’s use of his God-given free will, whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force;
the self
That liberty is indivisible, and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom;
the nation,anti-communism
That the purpose of government is to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order, the provision of national defense, and the administration of justice;
law & order,the nation
That when government ventures beyond these rightful functions, it accumulates power, which tends to diminish order and liberty;
the opposition
That the Constitution of the United States is the best arrangement yet devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role, while restraining it from the concentration and abuse of power;
the nation
That the genius of the Constitution—the division of powers—is summed up in the clause that reserves primacy to the several states, or to the people, in those spheres not specifically delegated to the Federal government;
the nation,state's rights
That the market economy, allocating resources by the free play of supply and demand, is the single economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government, and that it is at the same time the most productive supplier of human needs;
anti-communism
That when government interferes with the work of the market economy, it tends to reduce the moral and physical strength of the nation; that when it takes from one man to bestow on another, it diminishes the incentive of the first, the integrity of the second, and the moral autonomy of both;
the opposition,anti-communism
That we will be free only so long as the national sovereignty of the United States is secure; that history shows periods of freedom are rare, and can exist only when free citizens concertedly defend their rights against all enemies;
foreign policy
That the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these liberties;
anti-communism
That the United States should stress victory over, rather than coexistence with, this menace; and that American foreign policy must be judged by this criterion: does it serve the just interests of the United States?
